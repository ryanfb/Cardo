Font Installation Instructions

Windows 95/98/Me
 using an unzip utility, extract the font and manual to a location that you can find later (it doesn't matter where; can be a temporary folder such as C:\temp, a folder you use for storing fonts, whatever)
 activate the Start button on the taskbar
 choose Settings/Control Panel; a window will open
 double-click on the Fonts icon and a new window will open
 choose File/Install New Font
 in the dialog box that appears, navigate to the drive and directory where you extracted the font; Windows will search for font names
 double-click on Cardo
 close the Font window
 read or print the manual for additional information about using Cardo
